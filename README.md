# GE 205-1: Engineering Analysis 1
Materials for Northwestern University's course [GEN_ENG 205-1: Engineering Analysis 1](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/electrical-computer/academics/courses/descriptions/205-EA-1-1.html). 

This repo contains my homework without any changes (so, it includes typos, poor formatting, bugs, etc). The mistakes are minor (eg, obvious typos in comments and inconsequentially missing finishing semicolons), so I haven't created new comments pointing them out. I have updated my homework files with the grade I received on them: perfect score on each, except one I finished but forgot to submit (but am still pretty sure is right).

Practice exam folders contain official practice exams I received the quarter I took the course (2023 Fall), as well as past years' real and practice exams I received from a friend.

The folder /exams contains the real exams I took for the course.
