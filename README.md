# GE 205-1: Engineering Analysis 1
Materials for Northwestern University's course [GEN_ENG 205-1: Engineering Analysis 1](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/electrical-computer/academics/courses/descriptions/205-EA-1-1.html). 

For now, this repo contains my homework without any changes (so, it includes typos, poor formatting, bugs, etc). For now, the mistakes are minor (eg, obvious typos in comments and inconsequentially missing finishing semicolons), so I haven't created new comments pointing them out. I will also remember to update my homework files with the grade I receive on them.

Practice exam folders contain official practice exams I received the quarter I took the course (2023 Fall), as well as past years' real and practice exams I received from a friend.

The folder /exams contains the real exams I took for the course.
